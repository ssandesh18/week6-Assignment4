        "Python’s Flask micro web framework can be used to build web-based apps for interacting and displaying data-driven content. Although Flask is more frequently associated with web development, it can also be used in data science to create straightforward web interfaces, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), and visualisation tools that enable data scientists and analysts to present their data and analyses in a user-friendly and interactive way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lightweight\n",
        "Flask’s minimalistic design makes it fast, efficient, and ideal for small to medium-sized projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Web developers are left with a certain amount of control as the modular design of the Flask framework lets functions be split out into interchangeable modules.\n",
        "\n",
        "The individual parts of the web app structure are moveable and testable on their own, which can make debugging source code much easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexibility\n",
        "Flask provides developers with the freedom to choose their tools and libraries, allowing for a tailored development experience for web development companies.\n",
        "\n",
        "A Flask app can grow and scale up as needed over time. Your project may start as a single Python file and expand with new code.\n",
        "\n",
        "This concept marries well with the principles of the Zen of Python which state that simplicity is better than complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Extensibility and Integration\n",
        "Flask supports extensions – a wide variety of them – enabling developers to add additional functionality to their applications.\n",

        "The Flask framework seamlessly integrates with various database systems, making it versatile and adaptable.\n",
